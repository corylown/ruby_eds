RubyEDS
=======

Ruby wrapper for the EDS API.

This will be modeled on the PythonEDS Wrapper on the EDS API Wiki. 

Eventually, the plan will be for this to integrate directly into the Blacklight/EDS project.

Not checked into this repository is a util.conf file that contains our EDS authentication credentials.
